                VFEdit Change Implementation: Version 3.20
                                01/15/99

Working:

3.20c.1 (done):
    1)  Fixed MS bug for long file name with spaces.

3.20b.0 (done):
    1)  Long file name creation of wave files; win 95/98 recognition of
        files with no attributes set.

3.20a.0 (done):
    1)  Fixed long file name support in NT.
	2)  Fixed: 10.5 sec file, scroll to 6 sec, cut 6 to end: Lost scroll bar.
    3)  Fixed: Position overflow (very large number) on play and scroll.
    4)  Update resource strings and help boxes to 1997 dates.
    5)  Added "rename or replace" message for downlevel VBDB300.DLL
    6)  Updated install program copyright dates.
    7)  No TSR string on Tom's caption bar.
    5)  Sample user submitted file NITCxxx.WAV - edit select doesn't get all.
    8)  Help: Echo decay and delay description switched.

3.20d.x (done):
    1)  "Edit .Ini File" Button: Can get confused if 
        miscellaneous .INI's are in various directories, but the defaults 
        will be read from the one in the Windows\ directory. Used 
        GetWindowsDirectory() to hard-code .INI path name.
    2)  Added fixes to WavFil.c (DLG OKI, WIOOutEnd() RIFF & DATA chunk lengths) 
    3)  Added fixes to FilLow.c (define llseek return)
    4)  Install: Removed InstallationCharacteristics setting
    5)  Help File: Improved tech support help section.
    6)  Install: It's OK to temporarily remove disk #1...
    7)  AudDev.cpp: Increase FRQSHFTHR to 1.25% for Dialogic 8092 sample rate
        compatability (used with EASE).
   13) 	Allow user to specify custom frequency in Device Select dialog box.
   14) Removed BBS phone number from .HLP file.

Done?
   19)  Update Help file with newer promotional text on ToolBox, etc.
   18)  Change "CCITT" references to "C-ITU (CCITT)"
   30)  File Open: tab to directory, hit enter to get directory list - nothing!
        File Open control intercepts enter key, does not permit any access!
   32)  Lev Elbert
        Sorted 200.vox after 1.vox (fixed 02/11/97)
        File Import does not remember file types.
        Out of memory error. (yadda, yadda, yadda)
        Position of last file used in file list box goes to bottom (fixed 02/11/97).
        File Open loses template vx??????.vox (AJM: not true - tested 02/11/97)
		Directory list label truncates logically.
    8)  A 3 KHz tone pasted into a 8 KHz file gets rolled off alot!! (need 6 pole?)
   15)  Ron Lytal: VFEdit renames files even if they are read-only. Then
        leaves the .BK1 file around, since it is RO.
   16)  Support for new Dialogic .wav files and playback in extended formats.
   17)  Crash on record! Added ulLvlByt to CWIOCBk::RecLvlChk(). MCI buffer
        pointer shift by ulBytCnt causes read past end of memory.
   18)  Inhibit DOS TSR selection on NT, inhibit Audio Dev Sel if no 
        devices present.
   19)  AudDevStp() does not return correct sample count - uses sample position
		from the Audio device - needs to map into source file - return in msec!!!
		SmpPosAdj() does not look quite right for looping adjustment - fixed.
   20)  Auto-select index on command line: SesEdtOpn() accepts segment description,
	    SesFilOpn() accepts description, SesFilSegLod() accepts description,
	    SesFilSegLod(), FIOSegSel() & VBSSegSel() accept SEGJMPQRY as 
	    "jump to without query".	
        (Steve Koerner needs for Expert Sys)
   21)  Move DLGFIO function calls into VFECIF for VFEdit.exe
   22)  Changed "blank" bitmap in MSOUTLIN.VBX to prevent crash on some
        Win 3.x machines (video driver related). 30 second delay problem 
        remains; removing all bitmaps appears to fix that, but is not viable.

To Do: 
	1)  ^C During effects or file load gives weird message:
        FioDev\FIOOFS.c & FilFIO.c: Return correct error codes (esp. for cancel)
    2)  Win 95 I/F Review: Register file types, primary verbs, icons in Registry
                         : Warning for multiple instances?
                         : Title bar and minimized icon contents?
    3)  Correct shortened input on MSADPCM file input.
    4)  Zoom to Fit with no selection should query when "Ask User" is set.
    5)  Zoom keyboard keys not reflected in menu check marks (lower level function).
    6)  Update "At:x" dialog box in status bar on stop playback. Behaves
		differently when zoomed vs no-zoom.
    7)  Allow generate tone to produce a sweep tone.
    8)  Selectable undo level count.
    9)  Play from at position marker.
   10)  WTS: Mute on playback, lower output on record. Do API's support?
   11)  MCI DLL: WaveOutSetVolume after checking with waveOutGetDevCaps
   12)  Improve "Edit Mix" volume level for file with unequal length.
   13)  Better user control of playback cursor position control.
   14)  On "extents Ask User", shoul default to "At Position".
   15)  NT 3.51: Detect and inhibit DIalogic TSR option.
   12)  Manual: Auto-backup is document sensitive.
   13)  Manual: Ease: FE_SYS\EXE\genload, d40chk, strt_d40.bat
   11)  Manual: Update "Using a Math Coprocessor" for 386 and above.
   12)  Manual: Improve tech support help section.
   13)  Manual: Remove references to "Dictaphone"
   14)  Manual: Add reference to "Wait for Call"
   18)  Manual: Document Command Line Macro function calls
   19)  Manual: "Working with dB Sample Section"
   20)  Manual: Note on D40A/B "best match" limitation

    4)  Exponential fade
    5)  Locate sound/silence
    6)  Snap to zero crossing
    7)  "Analyze" menu with average signal level & std deviation.
    8)  View in db (logarithmic scale). View in voltage level. Choice
        of view effects the parameters (% or dB) used in selection
        dialog boxes.
    9)  Cut Guard - guard on cut/ erase ADPCM to avoid weird effects
        from cutting near a high stepsize region.
   10)  On-hook after terminating flag (ie, default hook flag).
   11)  File & PCM format = AUTO: Auto-detects file format
   12)  Option to auto-load next prompt after a save operation.
   13)  On/Off hook, Loop current indicators.
   14)  Merge record into existing VBase format file.
   15)  Disk space on file open/save, remaining on record extents.
   16)  FFT freq shift, interpolate freq shift
   17)  OLE server
   18)  Inflection frequency shift
   19)  Play list
   20)  Silence compression/ elimination
   21)  Playback to designated point & begin record (pacing)
   22)  10 bookmarks, 10 range marks
   23)  Preview mix, more than 2, file browse box
   24)  Drag & Drop
   25)  Play "exclude region"
   26)  DC bias adjust?
   27)  Use oscillator bank to reduce low frequency noise. 
   29)  Set default view resolution in view configure dialog.
   30)  Add "defaults" API to replace NewVoice hacks in VB code.
   31)  Tom Cook, 6/98 - 3.2 - Separate file type memory for import/exp

3.00c.1 (done):
    1)  Modified WavFil.c to use replace FilGetPos with mmioSeek to fix
        wave file chsize error.

3.00c.0 (done):
    1) Modified WinMem.c GloMemUnL() to ignore NULL memory handle
    2) VFEReg.c: Changed fmemcpy to fstrncpy to avoid read past end off string.

    9) Install: web site next to 800 number; replace "VBase" with "Indexed"
   10) PCMQry.c: PCMByt2Sl (), set #pragma optimize("", off) (VxF related err).
   11) Command line SendKey() for delay and wait for completion.
   12) Medium Res, zoom, high; File Revert - both medium and high res checked!
   13) Load 8K 8 bit, copy, paste to 8K 4 bit - Get resample filter question
       because AudFilCmpChk() checks more than just frequency - modify, replace?
   14) MCIWav.c, DlgDig.c - Init szDesStr; 
       Unlock mem on failed block allocation or on/off hook.        
   15) Fixed install for TI/F DLL (SRCDIR) rename of old, CHECK TI/F DLL install!!

3.00b.0 (done):
    Removed conditional from VFECIF.RC (was for DLG only)

	Zoom uses center of visible region when near end of file fix:
	    Switching from View Res Medium to View Res Low goes to end of file.
	Echo over-modulation fix:
   		EffEch.c, line 112, line 119 - need to check for PCM overflow.
    File Exit: "Save File", "Yes" - doesn't exit!
       AudDocSav() - return TRUE if successful
    Insert Silence, Extents Selection - putting non-numerics causes abort.

       FntSel.frm - CmdOK_Click - check for valid range
       EffMix.frm - CmdOK_Click - return Val ()
