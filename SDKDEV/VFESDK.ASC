                      VFEdit SDK Components
                                
The Visual Basic Source code for VFEdit is available for download
in a file named VFESDK.ZIP. The SDK will produce a fully
functional "Working Demo" version of VFEdit that is limited to
two files per execution for testing purposes. After you modify
the SDK, ship us the Visual Basic project and we will re-compile
it here to create a full working version.
The VFEdit SDK requires the regular version of VFEdit 3.0, plus
the VBX's from three companies: Desaware, MicroHelp, and Software
FX. These are major VBX manufacturers , and their products are
readily available in the U.S. Since we have run-time distribution
rights for these products, but not development distribution
rights, you will need to purchase them if you wish to modify the
VBX-related program behavior. If the VFEdit SDK changes are
simple, however, you may find that you can make the changes to
the main (non-VBX) related VB files, and just ship us the updated
files.
