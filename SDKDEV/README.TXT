    The VFEdit Professional Prompt Editor Software Development Kit 
    (VFEdit SDK) provides Visual Basic source code for the VFEdit product.
    The SDK will produce a fully functional "Working Demo" version of 
    VFEdit that is limited to two files per execution for testing 
    purposes. After you modify the SDK, ship us the Visual Basic project 
    and we will re-compile it here to create a full working version.

To Unpack:
    Unzip using:
        PKUnzip *.zip -sCODE
    where the scramble CODE is provided to you by VISI after submission 
    and approval of our non-disclosure agreement.
