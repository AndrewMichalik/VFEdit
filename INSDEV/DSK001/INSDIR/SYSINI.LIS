 <B>The <R>shared memory segment base address<B> tells VFEdit how your
    system is configured.
 If you know the shared memory address range for your voice board,
    enter it here. This number is typically from <R>D000<B> to <R>DFFF<B>,
    depending upon the number of boards and their switch settings.
 If you don't know your settings, leave the default of <R>D000-D200<B>. 
    VFEdit will then tell Windows not to try to use this memory for 
    other purposes. If you're unsure of these values, and Windows
    starts behaving erratically, you can always change them in your
    System.Ini file at a later time.
