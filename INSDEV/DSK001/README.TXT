                   VFEdit Professional Prompt Editor

         Sound your best! Let VFEdit(r) turn your multimedia or
    voice processing PC into a voice prompt recording studio.
    VFEdit edits sound the way a word processor edits text -
    with VFEdit you can see and hear the waveform while you
    work.
    
         VFEdit is the only native mode, direct-to-disk,
    integrated audio editor for the Microsoft Windows(r)
    environment. Native mode means you can edit compressed PCM
    instantly without losing fidelity with conversions. 
    Direct-to-disk capability lets you edit files of any size.
    Integrated editing lets work on files in one format - while 
    playing and recording them in another. Why? So you can create 
    perfect voice prompts for your applications.
