10.	Recommendation G.722:



7 kHz AUDIO-CODING WITHIN 64 KBIT/S





1.       General



1.1	Scope and outline description



	This Recommendation describes the characteristics of an audio (50 to  7 
000 Hz) coding system which may be used for a variety of higher quality 
speech applications. The coding system uses sub-band adaptive differen-
tial pulse code modulation (SB-ADPCM) within a bit rate of 64 kbit/s. 
The system is henceforth referred to as 64 kbit/s (7 kHz) audio coding. In 
the SB-ADPCM technique used, the frequency band is split into two sub-
bands (higher and lower) and the signals in each sub-band are encoded 
using ADPCM. The system has three basic modes of operation corre-
sponding to the bit rates used for 7 kHz audio coding:  64, 56 and 48 kbit/
s. The latter two modes allow an auxiliary data channel of 8 and 16 kbit/s 
respectively to be provided within the 64 kbit/s by making use of bits 
from the lower sub-band.



	Figure 1/G.722 identifies the main functional parts of the 64 kbit/s (7 
kHz) audio codec as follows:



	i)	64 kbit/s (7 kHz) audio encoder comprising:



               -     a transmit audio part which converts an audio signal to a

			uniform digital signal which is coded using 14 bits with

			16kHz sampling;



		-	a SB-ADPCM encoder which reduces the bit rate to 64kbit/s.  

	ii)	64 kbit/s (7 kHz) audio decoder comprising:



		-	a SB-ADPCM decoder which performs the reverse operation 
to the encoder noting that the effective audio coding bit rate at the 
input of the decoder can be 64, 56 or 48 kbit/s depending on the 
mode of operation;



		-	a receive audio part which reconstructs the audio signal from 
the uniform digital signal which is encoded using 14bits with 16 
kHz sampling.



	The following two parts, identified in Figure 1/G.722 for clarification, 
will be needed for applications requiring an auxiliary data channel within 
the 64 kbit/s:



		-	a data insertion device at the transmit end which makes use of, 
when needed, 1 or 2 audio bits per octet depending on the mode of 
operation and substitutes data bits to provide an auxiliary data chan-
nel of 8 or 16 kbit/s respectively;



		-	a data extraction device at the receive end which determines 
the mode of operation according to a mode control strategy and 
extracts the data bits as appropriate.

	ss 1.2 contains a functional description of the transmit and receive audio 
parts, ss 1.3 describes the modes of operation and the implication of 
inserting data bits on the algorithms, whilst ssss 1.4 and 1.5 provide the 
functional descriptions of the SB-ADPCM encoding and decoding algo-
rithms respectively. ss 1.6 deals with the timing requirements. ss 2 speci-
fies the transmission characteristics of the 64 kbit/s (7 kHz) audio codec 
and of the transmit and receive audio parts, ssss 3 and 4 give the princi-
ples of the SB- ADPCM encoder respectively whilst ssss 5 and 6 specify 
the computational details of the Quadrature Mirror Filters (QMF) and of 
the ADPCM encoders and decoders respectively.



	Networking aspects and test sequences are addressed in Appendices I and 
II respectively to this Recommendation.



	Recommendation G.725: "Systems aspects for the use of the 7 kHz 
audio-codec within 64 kbit/s" contains specifications for in-channel 
handshaking procedures for terminal identification and for mode control 
strategy, including interworking with existing 64 kbit/s PCM terminals.



1.2	Functional description of the audio parts



	Figure 2/G.722 shows a possible arrangement of audio parts in a 64kbit/
s (7 kHz) audio coding terminal. The microphone, pre-amplifier, power 
amplifier and loudspeaker are shown simply to identify the audio parts 
and are not considered further in this Recommendation.



	In order to facilitate the measurement of the transmission characteristics 
as specified in ss 2, test points A and B need to be provided as shown. 
These test points may either be for test purposes only or, where the audio 
parts are located in different units from the microphone, loudspeaker 
etc..., correspond to physical interfaces.



	The transmit and receive audio parts comprise either the following func-
tional units or any equivalent items satisfying the specifications of ss 2:  



	i)	transmit:



		-	an input level adjustment device,

		-	an input anti-aliasing filter,

		-	a sampling device operating at 16 kHz,

		-	an analogue-to-uniform digital converter with 14 bits and 			with 
16 kHz sampling;



	ii)	receive:



		-	a uniform digital-to-analogue converter with 14 bits and 			with 
16 kHz sampling,

		-	a reconstructing filter which includes x/sin x correction,

		-	an output level adjustment device.



1.3	Possible modes of operation and implications of inserting data



	The three basic possible modes of operation which correspond to the bit 
rates available for audio coding at the input of the decoder are defined in 
Table 1/G.722.

	See Appendix 1 for examples of applications using one or several of 
these modes and for their corresponding subjective quality.



	The 64 kbit/s (7 kHz) audio encoder uses 64 kbit/s for audio coding at all 
times irrespective of the mode of operation. The audio coding algorithm 
has been chosen such that, without sending any indication to the encoder, 
the least significant bit or two least significant bits of the lower sub-band 
may be used downstream from the 64 kbit/s (7 kHz) audio encoder in 
order to substitute the auxiliary data channel bits. However, to maximize 
the audio performance for a given mode of operation, the 64 kbit/s (7 
kHz) audio decoder must be optimized to the bit rate available for audio 
coding. Thus, this Recommendation describes three variants of the SB-
ADPCM decoder and, for applications requiring an auxiliary data chan-
nel, an indication must be forwarded to select in the decoder the variant 
appropriate to the mode of operation. Figure 1/G.722 illustrates the 
arrangement. It should be noted that the bit rate at the input of the 64 kbit/
s (7 kHz) audio decoder is always 64 kbit/s but comprising 64, 56 or 48 
kbit/s for audio coding depending on the mode of operation. From an 
algorithm viewpoint, the variant used in the SB-ADPCM decoder can be 
changed in any octet during the transmission. When no indication about 
the mode of operation is forwarded to the decoder, the variant corre-
sponding to Mode 1 should be used.



	A mode mismatch situation, where the variant used in the 64 kbit/s 
(7kHz) audio decoder for a given octet does not correspond to the mode 
of operation, will not cause misoperation of the decoder. However, to 
maximize the audio performance, it is recommended that the mode con-
trol strategy adopted in the data extraction device should be such as to 
minimize the duration of the mode mismatch. Appendix I gives further 
information on the effects of a mode mismatch. To ensure compatibility 
between various types of 64 kbit/s (7 kHz) audio coding terminals, it is 
recommended that, as a minimum, the variant corresponding to Mode 1 
operation is always implemented in the decoder.



	The mode control strategy could be derived from the auxiliary data chan-
nel protocol (see draft Recommendation G.725).



1.4	Functional description of the SB-ADPCM encoder



	Figure 3/G.722 is a block diagram of the SB-ADPCM encoder. A func-
tional description of each block is given below in ssss 1.4.1 to 1.4.4.



1.4.1	Transmit quadrature mirror filters (QMFs)



	The transmit QMFs comprise two linear-phase non-recursive digital fil-
ters which split the frequency band 0 to 8 000 Hz into two sub-bands: the 
lower sub-band (0 to 4 000 Hz) and the higher sub-band (4 000 to 8 000 
Hz). The input to the transmit QMFs, xin, is the output from the transmit 
audio part and is sampled at 16 kHz. The outputs, xL and xH, for the 
lower and higher sub-bands respectively, are sampled at 8 kHz.



1.4.2	Lower sub-band ADPCM encoder



	Figure 4/G.722 is a block diagram of the lower sub-band ADPCM 
encoder. The lower sub-band input signal, xL after subtraction of an esti-
mate, sL, of the input signal produces the difference signal, eL. An adap-
tive 60-level non-linear quantizer is used to assign six binary digits to the 
value of the differencesignal to produce a 48 kbit/s signal, IL.



	In the feedback loop, the two least significant bits of IL are deleted to 
produce a 4-bit signal ILt, which is used for the quantizer adaptation and 
applied to a 15-level inverse adaptive quantizer to produce a quantized 
difference signal, dLt. The signal estimate, sL is added to this quantized 
difference signal to produce a reconstructed version, rLt, of the lower 
sub-band input signal. Both the reconstructed signal and the quantized 
difference signal are operated upon by an adaptive predictor which pro-
duce the estimate, sL, of the input signal, thereby completing the feed-
back loop.



	4-bit operation, instead of 6-bit operation, in the feedback loops of both 
the lower sub-band ADPCM encoder, and the lower sub-band ADPCM 
decoder allows the possible insertion of data in the two least significant 
bits as described in ss 1.3 without causing misoperation in the decoder. 
Use of a 60- level quantizer (instead of 64-level) ensures the pulse den-
sity requirements as described in Recommendation G.802 are met under 
all conditions and in all modes of operation.



1.4.3	Higher sub-band ADPCM encoder



	Figure 5/G.722 is a block diagram of the higher sub-band ADPCM 
encoder. The higher sub-band input signal, xH after subtraction of an 
estimate, sH, of the input signal, produces the difference signal, eH. An 
adaptive 4-level non-linear quantizer is used to assign two binary digits 
to the value of the difference signal to produce a 16 kbit/s signal, IH.



	An inverse adaptive quantizer produces a quantized difference signal, 
dH, from these same two binary digits. The signal estimate, sH, is added 
to this quantized difference signal to produce a reconstructed version, rH, 
of the higher sub-band input signal. Both the reconstructed signal and the 
quantized difference signal are operated upon by an adaptive predictor 
which produces the estimate, sH, of the input signal, thereby completing 
the feedback loop.



1.4.4	Multiplexer



	The multiplexer (MUX) shown in Figure 3/G.722 is used to combine the 
signals, IL and IH, from the lower and higher sub-band ADPCM encod-
ers respectively into a composite 64 kbit/s signal, I, with an octet format 
for transmission.



	The output octet format, after multiplexing, is as follows:



	IH1 IH2 IL1 IL2 IL3 IL4 IL5 IL6



where IH1 is the first bit transmitted, and where IH1 and IL1 are the most 
significant bits of IH and IL respectively, whilst IH2 and IL6 are the least 
significant bits of IH and IL respectively.



1.5	Functional description of the SB-ADPCM decoder



	Figure 6/G.722 is a block diagram of the SB-ADPCM decoder. A func-
tional description of each block is given below in ssss 1.5.1 to 1.5.4.



1.5.1	Demultiplexer



	The demultiplexer (DMUX) decomposes the received 64 kbit/s octet-for-
matted signal, Ir, into two signals, ILr and IH, which form the codeword 
inputs to the lower and higher sub-band ADPCM decoders respectively.



1.5.2	Lower sub-band ADPCM decoder



	Figure 7/G.722 is a block diagram of the lower sub-band ADPCM 
decoder. This decoder can operate in any of three possible variants 
depending on the received indication of the mode of operation.



	The path which produces the estimate, sL, of the input signal including 
the quantizer adaptation, is identical to the feedback portion of the lower 
sub-band ADPCM encoder described in ss 1.4.2. The reconstructed sig-
nal, rL, is produced by adding to the signal estimate one of three possible 
quantized difference signals, dL,6, dL,5 or dL,4 (= dLt - see note), 
selected according to the received indication of the mode of operation. 
For each indication, Table2/G.722 shows the quantized difference signal 
selected, the inverse adaptive quantizer used and the number of least sig-
nificant bits deleted from the input codeword.

Note - For clarification purposes, all three inverse quantizers have been 
indicated in the upper portion of Figure 7/G.722. In an optimized imple-
mentation, the signal dLt, produced in the predictor loop, could be substi-
tuted for dL,4.



1.5.3	Higher sub-band ADPCM decoder



	Figure 8/G.722 is a block diagram of the higher sub-band ADPCM 
decoder. This decoder is identical to the feedback portion of the higher 
sub-band ADPCM encoder described in ss 1.4.3, the output being the 
reconstructed signal, rH.



1.5.4	Receive QMFs



	The receive QMFs shown in Figure 6/G.722 are two linear-phase non-
recursive digital filters which interpolate the outputs, rL and rH, of the 
lower and higher sub-band ADPCM decoders from 8 kHz to 16 kHz and 
which then produce an output, xout, sampled at 16 kHz which forms the 
input to the receive audio parts.



	Excluding the ADPCM coding processes, the combination of the trans-
mit and the receive QMFs has an impulse response which closely approx-
imates a simple delay whilst, at the same time, the aliasing effects 
associated with the 8 kHz sub-sampling are cancelled.

1.6	Timing requirements



	64 kHz bit timing and 8 kHz octet timing should be provided by the net-
work to the audio decoder.



	For a correct operation of the audio coding system, the precision of the 
16 kHz sampling frequencies of the A/D and D/A converters must be bet-
ter than + 50.10-6.



2.	Transmission characteristics



2.1	Characteristics of the audio ports and the test points



	Figure 2/G.722 indicates the audio input and output ports and the test 
points (A and B). It is for the designer to determine the characteristics of 
the audio ports and the test points (i.e. relative levels, impedances, 
whether balanced or unbalanced). The microphone, pre-amplifier, power 
amplifier and loudspeaker should be chosen with reference to the specifi-
cations of the audio parts: in particular their nominal bandwidth, idle 
noise and distortion.



	It is suggested that input and output impedances should be high and low, 
respectively, for an unbalanced termination whilst for a balanced termi-
nation these impedances should be 600 ohms. However, the audio parts 
should meet all audio parts specifications for their respective input and 
output impedance conditions.



2.2	Overload point



	The overload point for the analogue-to-digital and digital-to-analogue 
converters should be + 9 dBmO + 0.3 dB. This assumes the same nomi-
nal speech level (see Recommendation G.232) as for 64 kbit/s PCM but 
with a wider margin for the maximum signal level which is likely to be 
necessary with conference arrangements. The measurement method of 
the overload point is under study.



2.3	Nominal reference frequency



	Where a nominal reference frequency of 1 000 Hz is indicated below, the 
actual frequency should be chosen equal to 1 020 Hz. The frequency tol-
erance should be +2 to -7 Hz.



2.4	Transmission characteristics of the 64 kbit/s (7 kHz) audio codec



	The values and limits specified below should be met with a 64 kbit/s 
(7kHz) audio encoder and decoder connected back-to-back. For practical 
reasons, the measurements may be performed in a looped configuration 
as shown in Figure9a/G.722. However, such a looped configuration is 
only intended to simulate an actual situation where the encoder and 
decoder are located at the two ends of a connection.



	These limits apply to operation in Mode 1.



2.4.1	Nominal bandwidth



	The nominal 3 dB bandwidth is 50 to 7 000 Hz.



2.4.2	Attenuation/frequency distortion



	The variation with frequency of the attenuation should satisfy the limits 
shown in the mask of Figure 10/G.722. The nominal reference frequency 
is 1 000 Hz and the test level is -10 dBmO.



2.4.3	Absolute group delay



	The absolute group delay, defined as the minimum group delay for a sin-
ewave signal between 50 and 7 000 Hz, should not exceed 4 ms. The test 
level is -10 dBmO.



2.4.4	Idle noise



	The unweighted noise power measured in the frequency range 50 to 
7000Hz with no signal at the input port (test point A) should not exceed 
-66dBmO. When measured in the frequency range 50 Hz to 20 kHz the 
unweighted noise power should not exceed -60 dBmO.



2.4.5	Single frequency noise



	The level of any single frequency (in particular 8 000 Hz, the sampling 
frequency and its multiples), measured selectively with no signal at the 
input port (test point A) should not exceed -70 dBmO.



2.4.6	Signal-to-total distortion ratio



	Under study.



2.5	Transmission characteristics of the audio parts



	When the measurements indicated below for the audio parts are from 
audio-to-audio, a looped configuration as shown in Figure 9b/G.722 
should be used. The audio parts should also meet the specifications of ss 
2.4 with the measurement configuration of Figure 9b/G.722.



2.5.1	Attenuation/frequency response of the input anti-aliasing filter



	The in-band and out-of-band attenuation/frequency response of the input 
anti-aliasing filter should satisfy the limits of the mask shown in 
Figure11/G.722. The nominal reference frequency is 1 000 Hz and the 
test level for the in-band characteristic is -10 dBmO. Appropriate mea-
surements should be made to check the out-of-band characteristic taking 
into account the aliasing due to the 16 kHz sampling.



2.5.2	Attenuation/frequency response of the output reconstructing filter



	The in-band and out-of-band attenuation/frequency response of the out-
put reconstructing filter should satisfy the limits of the mask shown in 
Figure 12/G.722. The nominal reference frequency is 1 000 Hz and the 
test level for the in-band characteristic is -10 dBmO. Appropriate mea-
surements should be made to check the out-of-band characteristic taking 
into account the aliasing due to the 16 kHz sampling. The mask of Figure 
12/G.722 is valid for the whole of the receive audio part including any 
pulse amplitude modulation distortion and x/sin x correction.



2.5.3	Group delay distortion with frequency



	The group delay distortion, taking the minimum value of group delay as a 
reference, should satisfy the limits of the mask shown in Figure 13/
G.722.

2.5.4	Idle noise for the receive audio part



	The unweighted noise power of the receive audio part measured in the 
frequency range 50 to 7 000 Hz with a 14-bit all-zero signal at its input 
should not exceed -75 dBmO.



2.5.5	Signal-to-total distortion ratio as a function of input level



	With a sine wave signal at a frequency excluding simple harmonic rela-
tionships with the 16 kHz sampling frequency, applied to test point A, the 
ratio of signal-to-total distortion power as a function of input level mea-
sured unweighted in the frequency range 50 to 7 000 Hz at test point B, 
should satisfy the limits of the mask shown in Figure 14/G.722. Two 
measurements should be performed, one at a frequency of about 1 kHz 
and the other at a frequency of about 6 kHz.



2.5.6	Signal-to-total distortion ratio as a function of frequency



	With a sine wave signal at a level of -10 dBmO applied to test point A,the 
ratio of signal-to-total distortion power as a function of frequency mea-
sured unweighted in the frequency range 50 to 7 000 Hz at test point B 
should satisfy the limits of the mask shown in Figure 15/G.722.



2.5.7	Variation of gain with input level



	With a sine wave signal at the nominal reference frequency of 1 000 Hz, 
but excluding the sub-multiple of the 16 kHz sampling frequency, applied 
to test point A, the gain variation as a function of input level relative to 
the gain at an input level of -10 dBmO measured selectively at test point 
B, should satisfy the limits of the mask shown in Figure 16/G.722.



2.5.8	Intermodulation



	Under study.



2.5.9	Go/return crosstalk



	The crosstalk from the transmit direction to the receive direction should 
be such that, with a sine wave signal at any frequency in the range 50 to 7 
000 Hz and at a level of +6 dBmO applied to test point A, the crosstalk 
level measured selectively at test point B should not exceed -64 dBmO. 
The measurement should be made with a 14-bit all-zero digital signal at 
the input to the receive audio part.



	The crosstalk from the receive direction to the transmit direction should 
be such that, with a digitally simulated sine wave signal at any frequency 
in the range of 50 to 7 000 Hz and a level of +6 dBmO applied to the 
input of the receive audio part, the crosstalk level measured selectively 
and with the measurement made digitally at the output of the transmit 
audio part should not exceed -64 dBmO. The measurement should be 
made with no signal at test point A, but with the test point correctly ter-
minated.



2.6	Transcoding to and from 64 kbit/s PCM



	For compatibility reasons with 64 kbit/s PCM, transcoding between 
64kbit/s (7 kHz) audio coding and 64 kbit/s PCM should take account of 
the relevant specifications of Recommendations G.712, G.713 and 
G.714. When the audio signal is to be heard through a loudspeaker, more 
stringent specifications may be necessary. Further information may be 
found in Appendix 1.

3.	SB-ADPCM encoder principles



	A block diagram of the SB-ADPCM encoder is given in Figure 3/G.722. 
Block diagrams of the lower and higher sub-band ADPCM encoders are 
given respectively in Figures 4/G.722 and 5/G.722.



	Main variables used for the descriptions in ssss 3 and 4 are summarized 
in Table 3/G.722. In these descriptions, index (j) indicates a value corre-
sponding to the current 16 kHz sampling interval, index (j-l) indicates a 
value corresponding to the previous 16 kHz sampling interval, index (n) 
indicates a value corresponding to the current 8 kHz sampling interval, 
and index (n-l) indicates a value corresponding to the previous 8 kHz 
sampling interval. Indices are not used for internal variables, i.e. those 
employed only within individual computational blocks.



3.1	Transmit QMF



	A 24-coefficient QMF is used to compute the lower and higher sub-band 
signal components. The QMF coefficient values, hi, are given in Table 4/
G.722.



	The output variables, xL(n) and xH(n), are computed in the following 
way:



	xL(n) = xA + xB                                               (1)



         xH(n) = xA - xB                                               (2)



where

              11

	xA =  S h2i.xin(j - 2i)                                       (3)

              i=0



              11

	xB =  S h2i+1.xin(j - 2i - 1)                                 (4)

              i=0



3.2	Difference signal computation



	The difference signal, eL(n) and eH(n), are computed by subtracting pre-
dicted values, sL(n) and sH(n), from the lower and higher sub-band input 
values, xL(n) and xH(n):



	eL(n) = xL(n) - sL(n)                                         (5)



	eH(n) = xH(n) - sH(n)                                         (6)

3.3	Adaptive quantizer



	The difference signals, eL(n) and eH(n), are quantized to 6 and 2 bits for 
the lower and higher sub-bands respectively. Tables 5/G.722 and 6/G.722 
give the decision levels and the output codes for the 6- and 2-bit quantiz-
ers respectively. In these tables, only the positive decision levels are indi-
cated, the negative levels can be determined by symmetry. mL and mH 
are indices for the quantizer intervals. The interval boundaries, LL6, 
LU6, HL and HU, are scaled by computed scale factors, _L(n) and _H(n) 
(see ss 3.5). Indices, mL and mH, are then determined to satisfy the fol-
lowing:



	LL6(mL)._L(n) _ eL(n) < LU6(mL)._L(n)                      (7)



	HL(mH)._H(n) _ eH(n) < HU(mH)._H(n)                        (8)



for the lower and higher sub-bands respectively.



	The output codes, ILN and IHN, represent negative intervals, whilst the 
output codes, ILP and IHP, represent positive intervals. The output codes, 
IL(n) and IH(n), are then given by:



                   + ILP(mL) , if eL (n) _ 0

	IL (n) =  +                                                (9)

                   + ILN(mL) , if eL (n) < 0

                    



	          + IHP(mH) , if eH (n) _ 0

         IH (n) =  +                                                (10)

                   + IHN(mH) , if eH (n) < 0

                    





for the lower and higher sub-bands respectively.

3.4	Inverse adaptive quantizers



3.4.1	Inverse adaptive quantizer in the lower sub-band ADPCM encoder



	The lower sub-band output code, IL(n), is truncated by two bits to pro-
duce ILt(n). The 4-bit codeword, ILt(n), is converted to the truncated 
quantized difference signal, dLt(n), using the QL4-1 output values of 
Table7/G.722, and scaled by the scale factor, _L(n):



	dLt(n) = QL4-1(ILt(n))._L(n).sgn(ILt(n))                   (11)



where sgn (ILt(n)) is derived from the sign of eL(n) defined in equation 
9.



	There is a unique mapping, shown in Table 7/G.722, between four adja-
cent 6-bit quantizer intervals and the QL4-1 output values. QL4-1(ILt(n)) 
is determined in two steps: first determination of the quantizer interval 
index, mL, corresponding to IL(n) from Table 5/G.722, and then determi-
nation of

QL4-1(mL) by reference to Table 7/G.722.



3.4.2	Inverse adaptive quantizer in the higher sub-band ADPCM encoder



	The higher sub-band output code, IH(n) is converted to the quantized dif-
ference signal, dH(n), using the Q2-1 output values of Table 8/G.722 and

scaled by the scale factor, _H(n):



	dH(n) = Q2-1(IH(n))._H(n).sgn(IH(n))                       (12)

where sgn (IH(n)) is derived from the sign of eH(n) defined in equaltion 
(10), and where Q2-1(IH(n)) is determined in two steps: first determine 
the quantizer interval index, mH, corresponding to IH(n) from Table 6/
G.722 and then determine Q2-1(mH) by reference to Table 8/G.722.



3.5	Quantizer adaptation



	This block defines _L(n) and _H(n), the scaling factors for the lower and 
higher sub-band quantizers. The scaling factors are updated in the log 
domain and subsequently converted to a linear representation. For the 
lower sub- band, the input is ILt(n), the codeword truncated to preserve 
the four most significant bits. For the higher sub-band, the 2-bit quantizer 
output, IH(n), is used directly.



	Firstly the log scaling factors, _L(n) and _H(n), are updated as follows:





          L(n) = B. L(n-1)÷WL(ILt(n-1))                              (13)



          H(n) = B. H(n-1)÷WH(IH(n-1))                               (14)





where WL(.) and Wy(.) are logarithmic scaling factor multipliers given in 
Tables7/G.722 and 8/G.722, and B is a leakage constant equal to 127/
128.



	Then the log scaling factors are limited, according to:





         0 _  L(n) _ 9                                               (15)



         0 _  H(n) _ 11                                              (16)





	Finally, the linear scaling factors are computed from the log scaling fac-
tors, using an approximation of the inverse log2 function:





         _L(n) = 2( L(n)÷2)_min                                      (17)



         _H(n) = 2 H(n)_min                                          (18)





where _min is equal to half the quantizer step size of the 14 bit analogue-
to-digital converter.



3.6	Adaptive prediction



3.6.1	Predicted value computations



	The adaptive predictors compute predicted signal values, sL(n) and 
sH(n), for the lower and higher sub-bands respectively.



	Each adaptive predictor comprises two sections: a second-order section 
that models poles, and a sixth-order section that models zeroes in the 
input signal.



	The second order pole sections (coefficients aL,i and aH,i) use the quan-
tized reconstructed signals, rLt(n) and rH(n), for prediction. The sixth 
order zero sections (coefficients bL,i and bH,i) use the quantized differ-
ence signals, dLt(n) and dH(n). The zero-based predicted signals, sLz(n) 
and sHz(n), are also employed to compute partially reconstructed signals 
as described in ss3.6.2.













































































4.	SB-ADPCM decoder principles



	A block diagram of the SB-ADPCM decoder is given in Figure 6/G.722 
and block diagrams of the lower and higher sub-band ADPCM decoders 
are given respectively in Figures 7/G.722 and 8/G.722.



	The input to the lower sub-band ADPCM decoder, ILr, may differ from 
IL even in the absence of transmission errors, in that one or two least sig-
nificant bits may have been replaced by data.



4.1	Inverse adaptive quantizer



4.1.1	Inverse adaptive quantizer selection for the lower sub-band 
ADPCM 	decoder



	According to the received indication of the mode of operation the number 
of least significant bits which should be truncated from the input code-
word ILr, and the choice of the inverse adaptive quantizer are deter-
mined, as shown in Table 2/G.722.



	For operation in mode 1, the 6-bit codeword, ILr(n), is converted to the 
quantized difference, dL(n), according to QL6-1 output values of 
Table7/G.722, and scaled by the scale factor, _L(n):



	dL(n) = QL6-1(ILr(n))._L(n).sgn (ILr(n))                        (39)



where sgn (ILr(n)) is derived from the sign of IL(n) defined in equation 
(9).



	Similarly, for operations in mode 2 or mode 3, the truncated codeword 
(by one or two bits) is converted to the quantized difference signal, 
dL(n), according to QL5-1 or QL4-1 output values of Table 7/G.722 
respectively.



	There are unique mappings, shown in Table 7/G.722, between two or 
four adjacent 6-bit quantizer intervals and the QL5-1 or QL4-1 output 
values respectively.



	In the computations above, the output values are determined in two steps: 
first determination of the quantizer interval index, mL, corresponding to 
ILr(n) from Table 5/G.722, and then determination of the output values 
corresponding to mL by reference to Table 7/G.722.



	The inverse adaptive quantizer, used for the computation of the predicted 
value and for adaptation of the quantizer and predictor, is described in ss 
3.4.1, but with IL(n) replaced by ILr(n).

	The output reconstructed signal for the lower sub-band ADPCM decoder, 
rL(n), is computed from the quantized difference signal, dL(n), as fol-
lows:



	rL(n) = SL(n) + dL(n)                                       (40)

	See ss 3.6.4.



4.4	Receive QMF



	A 24-coefficient QMF is used to reconstruct the output signal, xout(j), 
from the reconstructed lower and higher sub-band signals, rL(n) and 
rH(n). The QMF coefficient values, hi, are the same as those used in the 
transmit QMF and are given in Table 4/G.722.



	The output signals, xout(j) and xout(j+1), are computed in the following 
way:





                                                                     (41)







                                                                     (42)









                                                                     (43)





                                                                     (44)

5.	Computational details for QMF



5.1	Input and output signals



	Table 9/G.722 defines the input and output signals for the transmit and 
receive QMF. All input and output signals have 16-bit word-lengths, 
which are limited to a range of -16384 to 16383 in 2's complement nota-
tion. Note that the most significant magnitude bit of the A/D output and 
the D/A input appears at the third bit location in XIN and XOUT, respec-
tively.



5.2	Description of variables and detailed specification of sub-blocks



	This section contains a detailed expansion of the transmit and receive 
QMF. The expansions are illustrated in Figures 17/G.722 and 18/G.722 
with the internal variables given in Table 10/G.722, and the QMF coeffi-
cients given in Table 11/G.722. The word-lengths of the internal vari-
ables, XA, XB and WD, must be equal to or greater than 24 bits (see 
Note 1). The other internal variables have a minimum of 16 bit word-
lengths. A brief functional description and the full specification is given 
for each sub-block.



	The notations used in the block descriptions are as follows:



	>>n	denotes an n-bit arithmetic shift right operation (sign 		
extension),



	+	denotes arithmetic addition with saturation control which 		
forces the result to minimum or maximum representable value 		in 
case of underflow or overflow, respectively,



	-	denotes arithmetic subtraction with saturation control which 		
forces the result to minimum or maximum representable value 		in 
case of underflow or overflow, respectively.



	*	denotes arithmetic multiplication which can be performed with 		
either truncation or rounding,



	<	denotes the "less than" condition as x < y; x is less than y, 

	>	denotes the "greater than" condition, as x > y; x is greater 		than 
y,



	= 	denotes the substitution of right-hand variable for left-hand 		
one.



Note 1 - Some freedom is offered for the implementation of the accumu-
lation process in the QMF: the word-lengths of the internal variables can 
be equal to or greater than 24 bits, and the arithmetic multiplications can 
be performed with either truncation or rounding. It allows a simplified 
implementation on various types of processors. The counterpart is that it 
excludes the use of digital test sequence for the test of the QMF.
